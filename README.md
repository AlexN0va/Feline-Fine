# Feline-Fine

#### During the Berkeley PREP program, my team and I noticed the disparity in healthcare checkups between low-income and higher-income individuals. To bridge this gap, we collaborated to create a human-centered and friendly 3D-printed cat that can monitor blood oxygen, BPM, and temperature. This serves not only as a positive way for people to continuously check their health but also as an opportunity for schools, building owners, and homeowners to demonstrate their concern for their visitors' health.

## My Role
As a programmer and designer, I worked to use numerous Arduino libraries like SparkFun and Onshape to make a functioning prototype.
